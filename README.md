### setup instructions

in order to get past the cors issues I use cypress, run using 

``` npx cypress open ```

after running npm install and run by going through the component test and run the formModal test

the frontend DOES run and build with docker, docker-compose -build and docker-compose -up

but you won't get the drop down.

Run the backend first so the list for the dropDown of supervisors can be populated.
